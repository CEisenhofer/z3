TPTP front-end and utilities as a sample using the C++ bindings.
To build the example execute
   make examples
in the build directory.

This command will create the executable tptp.
On Windows, you can just execute it.
On macOS and Linux, you must install z3 first using
   sudo make install
OR update LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (macOS)
   with the build directory. You need that to be able to 
   find the Z3 shared library.

The sample illustrates using Z3 from the TPTP language.
The TPTP language is documented on http://tptp.org
It also exposes utilities for converting between SMT-LIB 
and TPTP format.


Custom build with CMAKE:

Build instructions:

1. cd z3
2. mkdir release
3. cd release
4. cmake3 -DZ3_BUILD_LIBZ3_SHARED=FALSE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -G "Unix Makefiles" ../
5. make
6. make z3_tptp5
7. cp examples/tptp_build_dir/z3_tptp5 ../../bin/z3_tptp
